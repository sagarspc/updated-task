                    <h2>Share Purchase Agreement:</h2>
                    <p>A share purchase agreement is a legal contract between a buyer and a seller, sometimes stated in the contract as a “purchaser” and “vendor” -- in which the seller sells a stated number of shares at a stated price. The agreement is
                        proof that the sale and its terms were mutually agreed upon.</p>

                    <p><b>Shareholders Agreement:</b></p>

                    <p>A shareholders’ agreement is, as you might expect, an agreement between the shareholders of a company. It can be between all or, in some cases, only some of the shareholders (like, for instance, the holders of a particular class of
                        share). Its purpose is to protect the shareholders’ investment in the company, to establish a fair relationship between the shareholders and govern how the company is run.</p>
                    <p><b>The agreement will:</b></p>
                    <P>• Set out the shareholders’ rights and obligations;</P>
                    <P>• regulate the sale of shares in the company;</P>
                    <P>• describe how the company is going to be run;</P>
                    <P>• provide an element of protection for minority shareholders and the company; and</P>
                    <P>• define how important decisions are to be made.</P>

                                        <P>A founders’ agreement is a document, involving a company with two or more founders, specifying the details of the development of the company, such as the share of ownership and guaranteed obligations of the different
                                            founders. It also includes the responsibilities and roles of the founding members, their invested equity, their various undertakings, and their projections and goals. A founders’ agreement is drafted during
                                            the initial incorporation of the business.</P>
                                        <p>
                                            The purpose of a founders' agreement is to avoid any ambiguity that might develop in the future in regards to the company's management and business relations between founders. The agreement identifies potential complications and risks and provides provisions
                                            to deal with them should they arise. As a legally binding document, it must be detailed and lack any loopholes that may be exploited later. It is always a good idea to draft a written agreement after seeking
                                            an expert's counsel regarding the business's requirements and intentions.
